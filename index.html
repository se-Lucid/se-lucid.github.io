  	<h2>My Name is Lucas Battiste</h2>
  	<h3>Game Design Career</h3>
  	  <p> 
I am currently attending SUNY CANTON for a Bachelors degree in Game Design and Development. I’ve created a bunch of indie projects at my time here. I have them listed up above! 
	  </p>
	<h3>Game Design Club</h3>
  	  <p> 
I started the Game Design Club at my school. I wanted to create a club for students who wanted to make games but didn’t know how to ignite that spark. So I wanted to give people a reason to make games. It took quite a bit of time to establish and develop into what it is today!

	<h3>Eagle Scout</h3>
  	  <p> 
I first joined the Scouts at eight years old and stuck with it all the way up until eighteen. I then proceeded to complete all the requirements, merit badges, and finally, my Eagle Scout Project. 
For my Eagle Scout Project I constructed a cabinet to hold personal protective equipment in for my High School. With the extra money bought three 3D printers to make face masks with (they were cloaser to visors). At the end of the project i donated the 3D printers to the Kings Park Robotics Club (First Robotics Team 5736) for use in thier lab.
