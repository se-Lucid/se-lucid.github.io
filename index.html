  	<h2>My Name is Lucas Bleh! :3</h2>
  	<h3>Game Design Career</h3>
  	  <p> 
I am currently attending SUNY CANTON for a Bachelors degree in Game Design and Development. I’ve created a bunch of indie projects at my time here. I have them listed up above! 
	  </p>
	<h3>Game Design Club</h3>
  	  <p> 
I started the Game Design Club at my school. I wanted to create a club for students who wanted to make games but didn’t have that spark. So I wanted to give people a reason to make games. It took quite a bit of time to establish and develop into what it is today!

	<h3>Eagle Scout</h3>
  	  <p> 
I first joined the Scouts at eight years old and stuck with it all the way up until eighteen. I then proceeded to complete all the requirements, merit badges, and my Eagle Scout project.
