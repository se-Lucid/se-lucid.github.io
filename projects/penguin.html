  	<h2>December 6th 2025</h2>
  	  <p>This was a game created as a collective effort by the game design club. We were invited to help entertain children at a children’s holiday party for SUNY Canton. We took that as an invitation to see if we could come up with something fun. What we came up with was an Internet runner, where you had to try to grow your snowball as big as possible. Everyone who came to the station said they loved it, including the event organizer and her son.
